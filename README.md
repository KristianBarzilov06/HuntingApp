# Application for Hunting Associations
**Diploma Project**

## Overview
This mobile application is designed specifically for hunting associations, allowing members to register, plan events, track their trophies, and share information with each other. The app focuses on building a localized, private community with features tailored for hunters, helping them communicate, share achievements, and organize outings within their territory.

## Target Audience
- Primarily adult hunters aged between 18 to 60 years old, offering an intuitive interface that caters to both younger and older users.

## Unique Value
Unlike existing Bulgarian apps, such as the “IAG Electronic Hunting Permit,” which focuses on national-level permits and logging, this application caters exclusively to private hunting associations, emphasizing event organization, community interaction, and localized tracking. Additionally, there is the online site BG LOV, which offers only news, advertisements for selling weapons, and a test for young hunters. Other similar platforms include Facebook groups, but they are not specialized for hunters. A Facebook group does not cover the unique functionalities that my application offers, such as detailed event management, catch tracking, and secure communication channels specifically designed for hunting associations. This localized, personalized approach fills a unique gap in the market, providing a comprehensive solution tailored to the needs of Bulgarian hunting associations.
