# Application for Hunting Associations
**Diploma Project**

## Overview
This mobile application is designed specifically for hunting associations, allowing members to register, plan events, track their trophies, and share information with each other. The app focuses on building a localized, private community with features tailored for hunters, helping them communicate, share achievements, and organize outings within their territory.

## Target Audience
- Primarily adult hunters aged between 18 to 60 years old, offering an intuitive interface that caters to both younger and older users.

## Features

### 1. **User Registration and Profiles**
- **Member Registration**: Users register using information from their hunting licenses issued by the Executive Forestry Agency (EFA/ИАГ) for validation.
- **Personal Profiles**: Each member has a profile with information about themselves, their equipment, and recent hunting trophies.
- **Roles**: The app supports three user roles — Chairman, Member, Hunter(not a member) and Guest — each with specific permissions and access.

### 2. **Event Planning**
- **Organizing Events**: Members can organize events such as hunting trips and celebrations for the opening of the hunting season.
- **Event Management**: The chairman and other organizers can manage and track attendance for planned activities.

### 3. **Trophy Database**
- A comprehensive database for recording all members' catches, accessible to the entire group.
- Members can add details about their catches, including type, weight, and location, creating a shared repository of local achievements.
- By integrating this app for each hunting association, it will be possible to generate an accurate report of all animals caught by the hunting group at the end of the season, helping with wildlife management and environmental regulation.

### 4. **Discussion Forum**
- A dedicated forum for sharing advice, discussing strategies, and exchanging hunting techniques.
- Topics are specific to hunting, allowing members to engage in meaningful conversations within a trusted community.

### 5. **Photo and Video Gallery**
- A gallery where users can upload photos and videos from their trips, sharing memories and experiences exclusively within the community.
- Members can add descriptions to each media item, making the gallery a space for story-sharing and documenting events.

### 6. **News and Notifications**
- Localized news feed for updates on upcoming events, seasonal announcements, and important community reminders.
- Notifications alert members about events, changes, and financial updates, keeping everyone informed in real time.

### 7. **Private Community Membership**
- The app is exclusive to legitimate hunters, ensuring privacy and a localized interaction model.
- Members are verified, and only hunters within the designated territory have access, creating a close-knit community experience.

### 8. **Additional Communication Channels**
- **Private and Group Chats**: Secure chats for members to discuss events and plans, along with a private chat group solely for association members.
- **Guest Chat**: Separate chat for guests and association members.
- **Global Chat** (optional): A channel that allows communication between different associations.
- **Marketplace**: A dedicated space for buying and selling hunting dogs and weapons among members.
- **Lost and Found**: Channel for reporting stolen, lost, or found dogs, enabling quick community action. 
- **Lost Dogs Announcements for neighbouring groups**: A feature that allows members to send announcements about lost dogs to neighboring hunting associations, as a lost dog may have wandered into a nearby neighbouring association territory.

## Tech Stack
- **Front-end**: React Native for building a cross-platform mobile experience on Android.
- **Backend**: Firebase, managing user data, service logs, and event records securely.
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication for user login and verification.
- **Design**: Figma – Used for creating the design prototype.
- **Project Management**: Trello – Used to organize the action plan and track completed components.

## Development Progress (as of October 27, 2024)

## Unique Value
Unlike existing Bulgarian apps, such as the “IAG Electronic Hunting Permit,” which focuses on national-level permits and logging, this application caters exclusively to private hunting associations, emphasizing event organization, community interaction, and localized tracking. Additionally, there is the online site BG LOV, which offers only news, advertisements for selling weapons, and a test for young hunters. Other similar platforms include Facebook groups, but they are not specialized for hunters. A Facebook group does not cover the unique functionalities that my application offers, such as detailed event management, catch tracking, and secure communication channels specifically designed for hunting associations. This localized, personalized approach fills a unique gap in the market, providing a comprehensive solution tailored to the needs of Bulgarian hunting associations.
