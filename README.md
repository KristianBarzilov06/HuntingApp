## Unique Value
Unlike existing Bulgarian apps (e.g., “IAG Electronic Hunting Permit,” focusing on national permits/logs), this application is built for private hunting associations, emphasizing event organization, localized member interaction, and secure communication. It also surpasses platforms like BG LOV (primarily news and classifieds) or general Facebook groups by offering specialized features such as detailed event management, trophy tracking, and private, role-based channels. This personalized approach addresses the specific needs of Bulgarian hunting associations, creating a comprehensive, tailored solution.
